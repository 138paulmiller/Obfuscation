This BF interpreter makes use of the heap to allocate a very large stack and input space. Most of the code is very straighforward 
in terms of how the instructions are loaded into memory and then processed. But, I do believe this is of a particular breed of code 
since no arrays are every directly allocated.  
This program is only capable of interpreting the BF instruction set and any other characters read will cause undefined behaviours.
